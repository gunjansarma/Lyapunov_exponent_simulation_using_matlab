The Lyapunov Exponent is a mathematical concept used to quantify the sensitivity to initial conditions in a dynamical system, especially in chaotic systems. It measures how quickly nearby trajectories in the system diverge or converge over time. In a dynamical system, small differences in initial conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes over time, a phenomenon known as the butterfly effect. The Lyapunov Exponent helps characterize this sensitivity to initial conditions. Mathematically, if \( f \) represents the evolution of the system, the Lyapunov Exponent (\( \lambda \)) is computed as the exponential rate of divergence or convergence:

\[ \lambda = \lim_{{n \to \infty}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{{i=1}}^{n} \ln \left| \frac{df(x_i)}{dx_i} \right| \]

Here, \( x_i \) represents the trajectory in the system, and the Lyapunov Exponent is positive for chaotic systems, indicating exponential divergence, and negative for systems with stable trajectories.

The Lyapunov Exponent has applications in various scientific disciplines, including physics, meteorology, and biology. It helps characterize and predict the behavior of complex systems and is a key tool in the study of chaos theory. Understanding the Lyapunov Exponent provides insights into the predictability and stability of dynamic systems, contributing to our comprehension of the complex interplay of variables in natural and artificial systems.
